# Owndatum — Own your own datum

### A universal, privacy-first analytics platform for every device, every app, and every developer.

Owndatum is an open-source initiative to build the world’s most accessible, self-hostable, and developer-friendly analytics platform — designed for everyone from indie makers to global enterprises, from mobile apps to IoT devices running on a chip.

Our mission is simple:

> Analytics should belong to the creator — not to third-party clouds. <br/>
> Own a datum. Own your data. Own the product.

## 🌍 Vision

Owndatum aims to become the <b>default analytics layer for the entire software world</b> — mobile apps, web apps, backend services, internal tools, microcontrollers, edge devices, and everything in between.

Anyone should be able to:

- Track events with minimal code
- Host analytics on their own server (or a small VM)
- Keep user data private
- Scale from dozens of events to billions
- Integrate with any language or platform
- Understand user behavior without selling user privacy

This project starts small — a blank repo and a clear mission — but is designed to grow into a large, community-driven ecosystem.

## 🚀 The Journey Begins

Owndatum is more than a tool — it’s a movement toward <b>trustworthy, open, and universal analytics.</b>

Whether you're building:

- A small hobby app
- An enterprise-grade product
- An IoT firmware
- A backend service
- A game
- An internal company tool

Owndatum’s goal is to support you — <b>forever, for free, with full ownership.</b>

Let’s build the future of analytics together. <br/>
